TODO
====

This list is kept here, because they aren't really issues, and aren't well
defined enough to become tickets.

* Remove the limitation that requires a {Hay::Route} to define `self.tasks` before
  including `Hay::Route`

* Would be neat if Task::Templates were able to define a default flow.
